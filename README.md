# LeadGen AI Flow

AI-powered lead gen workflow built on **n8n**. It accepts GET requests on a webhook, filters seed companies by query params, generates industry-tailored insights, asks an LLM to draft a consultative outreach email, appends results to Google Sheets, and returns JSON.

## What it does
1. **Webhook (GET)** at path `leadgen`.  
2. **Seed Companies**: sample data for 3 companies.  
3. **Filter by Query Params (Python)**: supports `industry`, `location`, `sizeMin`, `sizeMax`.  
4. **Mock Insights (Python)**: adds 2â€“3 industry/location/size-based bullets.  
5. **AI Agent**: builds an outreach email from details + insights (JSON-only output).  
6. **Google Sheets Append**: writes Company/Subject/Body.  
7. **Respond JSON**: returns the parsed fields.

## Endpoints
- **Production**: `https://<your-n8n-host>/webhook/leadgen`  
- **Test mode**: `https://<your-n8n-host>/webhook-test/leadgen` (only while workflow is executing in Test)

### Examples

  `.../webhook/leadgen`
